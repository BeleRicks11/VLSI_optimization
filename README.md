# VLSI_optimization

**VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration)** refers to the trend of integrating circuits into silicon chips. 

The trend of shrinking transistor sizes, allowing engineers to fit more and
more transistors into the same area of silicon, enabled the modern cellphone to mature into a powerful tool with incredible features, that we can comfortably carry in a pocket.
In this way the VLSI problem led us to the development of search strategies in order to determine the optimal placement of the circuits on the silicon chips.

This report describes a Combinatorial and Decision making approach to deal with the VLSI problem; two different technologies have been employed, namely **Constraint Programming (CP)** and **Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT).**
